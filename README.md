# Coffee Shop Frontend

This application allows users to create an account, login, and place coffee orders. A node.js + mysql API is used to handle all the requests. Passwords are hashed using a bcrypt hashing function. Upon logging in, an accesss token is created and stored into local storage to store the user session.
